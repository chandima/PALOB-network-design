# PALOB AP Placement Supplementary Information Generator

This small Python utility converts an **OpenIntent** JSON export into an Excel workbook
that mirrors the structure of the *COOR AP Placement Supplementary Information* template.
Each worksheet corresponds to a floor in the building.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.9 or newer
* [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) (e.g. Miniconda)

## Installation

```bash
# Create and activate an isolated environment
conda create -n palob_ap_env python=3.10 -y
conda activate palob_ap_env

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python -m src.generate_excel openIntent_PALOB.json PALOB_AP_Placement_Supplementary_Information.xlsx
```

*Replace* `openIntent_PALOB.json` with the path to your actual OpenIntent file.  
The script will produce `PALOB_AP_Placement_Supplementary_Information.xlsx` in the
current directory (you can choose any output filename).

## How it works

1. Reads `accesspoints` from the OpenIntent JSON.
2. Groups APs by their `floorplan_name`.
3. Creates a worksheet per floor with the standard header row.
4. Populates one row per AP with sensible defaults for antenna and mounting fields.
5. Saves the workbook.

## Extending

* Update `HEADER` in `src/generate_excel.py` to change the column layout.
* Enhance `normalise_sheet_name` to support additional naming conventions.
* Map AP fields (e.g., antenna type, mount type) directly from JSON as needed.
